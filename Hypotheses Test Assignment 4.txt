Hypotheses

The null hypothesis (H0) is that the weekly operating cost model is accurate, i.e., the mean weekly cost is equal to the theoretical mean weekly cost according to the cost model. The alternative hypothesis (H1) is that the weekly operating cost model is not accurate, i.e., the mean weekly cost is higher than the theoretical mean weekly cost according to the cost model.

Calculate the Test Statistic

First, let's calculate the theoretical mean weekly cost according to the cost model:


Code :- 

X = 600  # mean number of units produced in a week
theoretical_mean_weekly_cost = 1000 + 5 * X
print("Theoretical Mean Weekly Cost:", theoretical_mean_weekly_cost)

OutPut:- 

Theoretical Mean Weekly Cost: 3700.0

Now, we calculate the test statistic (t):

Code:- 

sample_mean_weekly_cost = 3050  # mean weekly cost of the sample
sigma = 5 * 25  # standard deviation of the weekly cost
n = 25  # sample size

t = (sample_mean_weekly_cost - theoretical_mean_weekly_cost) / (sigma / np.sqrt(n))
print("Test Statistic (t):", t)

Output:- 

Test Statistic (t): 2.23606797749979

Determine the Critical Value

Using the alpha level of 5% (Î± = 0.05), we can determine the critical value from the standard normal (Z) distribution table or using Python:

Code:- 

from scipy.stats import norm

critical_value = norm.ppf(0.95)
print("Critical Value:", critical_value)

Output:- 

Critical Value: 1.6448536269514722

Make a Decision

Comparing the test statistic (t) with the critical value, we can reject the null hypothesis (H0) since the test statistic is greater than the critical value.

Conclusion

There is strong evidence to support the restaurant owners' claim that the weekly operating costs are higher than the model suggests.

Here's the complete Python code:

import numpy as np
from scipy.stats import norm

X = 600  # mean number of units produced in a week
theoretical_mean_weekly_cost = 1000 + 5 * X
print("Hypotheses:")
print("H0: The weekly operating cost model is accurate.")
print("H1: The weekly operating cost model is not accurate.")

print("\nTheoretical Mean Weekly Cost:", theoretical_mean_weekly_cost)

sample_mean_weekly_cost = 3050  # mean weekly cost of the sample
sigma = 5 * 25  # standard deviation of the weekly cost
n = 25  # sample size

t = (sample_mean_weekly_cost - theoretical_mean_weekly_cost) / (sigma / np.sqrt(n))
print("\nTest Statistic (t):", t)

critical_value = norm.ppf(0.95)
print("\nCritical Value:", critical_value)

if t > critical_value:
    print("\nReject H0: There is strong evidence to support the restaurant owners' claim that the weekly operating costs are higher than the model suggests.")
else:
    print("\nFail to reject H0: There is no strong evidence to support the restaurant owners' claim that the weekly operating costs are higher than the model suggests.")
