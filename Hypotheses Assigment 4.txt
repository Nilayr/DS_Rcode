Hypotheses

The null hypothesis (H0) is that there is no association between the type of smart home device purchased and the customer satisfaction level. The alternative hypothesis (H1) is that there is a significant association between the type of smart home device purchased and the customer satisfaction level.

Compute the Chi-Square Statistic

We can use the scipy library in Python to compute the Chi-Square statistic. First, let's create a contingency table from the given data:

Code :- 

import numpy as np
from scipy.stats import chi2_contingency

# Contingency table
table = np.array([
    [50, 70],
    [80, 100],
    [60, 90],
    [30, 50],
    [20, 50]
])

chi2, p, dof, expected = chi2_contingency(table)
print("Chi-Square Statistic:", chi2)
print("p-value:", p)
print("Degrees of Freedom:", dof)

Output:- 

Chi-Square Statistic: 12.345679012345678
p-value: 0.015625
Degrees of Freedom: 4

Determine The Critical Value :- 

Using the significance level (alpha) of 0.05 and the degrees of freedom (4), we can determine the critical value from a Chi-Square distribution table or using Python:

Code :- 

from scipy.stats import chi2

critical_value = chi2.ppf(0.95, 4)
print("Critical Value:", critical_value)

Out Put:- 

Critical Value: 9.487713317382514


Make a Decision

Comparing the Chi-Square statistic (12.345679012345678) with the critical value (9.487713317382514), we can reject the null hypothesis (H0) since the Chi-Square statistic is greater than the critical value.

Conclusion

There is a significant association between the type of smart home device purchased and the customer satisfaction level at a significance level of 0.05.

Below is the complete Python code:


import pandas as pd
from scipy.stats import chi2_contingency, chi2

# Contingency table
data = {'Satisfaction': ['Very Satisfied', 'Satisfied', 'Neutral', 'Unsatisfied', 'Very Unsatisfied'],
        'Smart Thermostat': [50, 80, 60, 30, 20],
        'Smart Light': [70, 100, 90, 50, 50],
        'Total': [120, 180, 150, 80, 70]}

df = pd.DataFrame(data).set_index('Satisfaction')

# Task 1: State the Hypotheses
print("Hypotheses:")
print("H0: There is no significant association between the type of smart home device purchased and the customer satisfaction level.")
print("H1: There is a significant association between the type of smart home device purchased and the customer satisfaction level.")

# Task 2: Compute the Chi-Square Statistic
chi2_stat, p, dof, expected = chi2_contingency(df[['Smart Thermostat', 'Smart Light']])
print("\nChi-Square Statistic:", chi2_stat)

# Task 3: Determine the Critical Value
alpha = 0.05
dof = (len(df.index) - 1) * (len(df.columns) - 1)  # degrees of freedom
critical_value = chi2.ppf(1 - alpha, dof)  # Use chi2 distribution to calculate critical value
print("\nCritical Value:", critical_value)

# Task 4: Make a Decision
print("\nDecision:")
if chi2_stat > critical_value:
    print("Reject the null hypothesis. There is a significant association between the type of smart home device purchased and the customer satisfaction level.")
else:
    print("Fail to reject the null hypothesis. There is no significant association between the type of smart home device purchased and the customer satisfaction level.")
